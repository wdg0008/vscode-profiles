# README

This repository hosts configuration profiles for Visual Studio Code profiles that I have found useful in development.
Instead of installing loads of extensions all at once, different workloads and languages are split up into profiles.
This allows the configuration and loading of only the tools that are immediately useful.
It also makes setting up future devices much simpler if you import all these (which requires internet, unfortunately).
